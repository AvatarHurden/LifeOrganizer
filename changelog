When a task's due date has no time component, it will not show how many hours are \n\tleft to complete it, but only days.\n\tbut correctly say \"tomorrow\".\n\t- Users are no longer able to access the archive in the program. This is only temporary, the ability to view (but not edit) your \n\tarchive will be restored in a later release.\n\t\n- **Bugfixes**\n\t- Now allows user to insert long notes without crashing (+100000 words)\n\t\n"
