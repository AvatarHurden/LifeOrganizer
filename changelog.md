# [Version 0.2](https://github.com/AvatarHurden/LifeOrganizer/releases/download/0.2/LifeOrganizer-0.2.exe)
- **Additions**
	- Added support for autocompletion of projects and contexts
	- On first launch, asks the user where to save the program files, instead of using program location
	
- **Changes**
	- Updater now asks the user where to save the downloaded file and starts it after downloading.
	- Lots of visual changes.
	- Due dates now are shown in a better way. When a task is due in the next day, it will no longer show that it will be due in x hours, 
	but correctly say "tomorrow".
	- Users are no longer able to access the archive in the program. This is only temporary, but the way it was before would not pass
	the idea that the archive was not supposed to be modified, since it was simply another file location.
	
- **Bugfixes**
	- Tasks stay sorted when changing between todo and done lists.
	- Now allows user to insert long notes without crashing (+100000 words)
	
- **Known bugs**
