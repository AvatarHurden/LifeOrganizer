**Do not download this version using the autoupdater. You must download the installer from the website**

- **Additions**
	- Added support for autocompletion of projects and contexts
	- On first launch, asks the user where to save the program files, instead of using program location
	
- **Changes**
	- Updater now asks the user where to save the downloaded file and starts it after downloading.
	- Lots of visual changes.
	- Due dates now are shown in a better way. When a task's due date has no time component, it will not show how many hours are 
	left to complete it, but only days.
	but correctly say "tomorrow".
	- Users are no longer able to access the archive in the program. This is only temporary, the ability to view (but not edit) your 
	archive will be restored in a later release.
	
- **Bugfixes**
	- Now allows user to insert long notes without crashing (+100000 words)
